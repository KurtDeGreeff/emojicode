    The 📑 class has many class methods which allow you to work with the file
    system.

    See the 📄 class for reading and writing.
🌮
🌍 🐇 📑 🍇
  🌮
    This method creates a directory at the given path.
    If the directory already exists an error is returned.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 📁 path 🔡 ➡️ 🍬🚨 📻
  🌮
    This method deletes the file at the given path.
    >!N This method may not be used to delete directories.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 🔫 path 🔡 ➡️ 🍬🚨 📻
  🌮
    This method deletes an *empty* directory at the given path.
    If you need to delete a whole directory hierarchy use 💣.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 🔥 path 🔡 ➡️ 🍬🚨 📻
  🌮
    This method deletes an directory with its content. The method recursively
    descends the directory hierarchy and deletes every file or directory it
    finds. Once finished, it deletes the directory itself.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 💣 path 🔡 ➡️ 🍬🚨 📻
  🌮 This method creates a symbolic link to another. 🌮
  🐇🐖 🔗 originalFile 🔡 destination 🔡 ➡️ 🍬🚨 📻
  🌮 Determines whether a file exists at the given path. 🌮
  🐇🐖 📃 path 🔡 ➡️ 👌 📻
  🌮
    Determines whether a file exists and the given path and if it is readable.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 📜 path 🔡 ➡️ 👌 📻
  🌮
    Determines whether a file exists and the given path and if it is writeable.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 📝 path 🔡 ➡️ 👌 📻
  🌮
    Determines whether a file exists and the given path and if it is executable.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 👟 path 🔡 ➡️ 👌 📻
  🌮
    Determines the size of a file at a given path. If the file cannot be found
    or any other error occurs the method returns -1.
  🌮
  🐇🐖 📏 path 🔡 ➡️ 🚂 📻
  🌮
    Returns an absolute pathname derived from `path` that
    resolves to the same directory entry, whose resolution does not involve `.`,
    `..`, or symbolic links. On failure Nothingness is returned.

    The 📄 class allows you to read and write to files.

    It provides several class methods which are shortcuts to reading and
    writing. They operate always on the whole file and reading can be very
    inefficient using these shortcuts when working with big files, because they
    will read the whole file into memory.
🌮
🌍 🐇 📄 🍇
  🌮
    Opens the file at the given path for writing. The file pointer is set to the
    beginning of the file and the file is truncated to zero length or created.

    This initializer returns nothingness if the file can not be opened for some
    reason. In many cases this occurs when you don’t have the permission to
    create or open the file.

    You cannot read from a file opened with this initializer.
